Step 1,The look (the robe)
Step 2,The smell (the nose)
Step 3,The taste (the mouth)
Step 4,The feeling
1. Look,The clarity and the color
Clarity,Brilliant - Bright - Clear - Dull - Hazy - Cloudy / Sediment? Crystals?
Color (White wine),"dilute, v. pale straw, pale straw, medium straw, yellow, lt. gold, medium gold, amber, tawny, adobe, brown"
Color (Red wine),"light / medium / dark: garnet, ruby red, purplish-red, or combinations / tawny, brown edge, any rim variation?"
Old color,"The older is a wine (white or red), the closer to the brown will the color be"
2. Smell,"The first sniff, swirling, and the second sniff"
First sniff,"Is the wine presentable? Fresh nose or aged-developed bouquet? OK to proceed? Any FAULTS? Corked, vinegary, oxidized / stale, stinky / eggy, sulfites"
Swirling,"Needs a good wine glass, makes the flavor easier to smell"
Second sniff,"Fruity / floral / spicy / berry / ripeness-level: under ripe through jammy, raisiny / estery / herbaceous / vegetal / grassy / nutty / minerally. Also, think about intensity. Woody: fresh woody, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, smoky-char,coconut "
3. Taste,"Find the basic tastes, the retro odors, and identify the mouthfeel (body), and measure the persistence"
Basic Tastes,"Sweetness, Acidity (sourness), Bitterness (think about balance)"
Retro-Odors,Do the retro-nasal odors while on your palate confirm the ortho-nasal odors? Any new odors?
Mouthfeel / Body,"The wine's weight (lt. body, medium body, full body) Mouthfeel: smooth or rough, astringent? Hotness from alcohol?"
Persistence,"Short (under 30 sec), medium (up to a minute), or long finish (a few minutes)"
4. Feeling,Did you like it? How much would you rank it (compare to other similar ones)
Two basic rules,Take your time. Be attentive
Blind tasting,"Tasting without seeing the bottle, and without knowing the price"
Tears,The tears you see from the wine does not mean that the wine is good or bad
Tricks for smelling,"Don't wear a perfume, train to identify every flavor to train your nose"
Tricks for looking,"Put a white background, a paper is good, and a reflection of sunlight would be the best"
Spitting,Spitting is recommended to stay fully lucid while tasting different wine
Sweet,It is the opposite of dry. If you eat a grape and you remove the skin you will find what sweet is. Be careful sweet doesn't mean fruity.
Acidity,"The sourness of the wine. In white wine, it compensates for the sweet taste. It generates saliva in your mouth."
Tannin,"The bitterness of the red wine, it comes from the skin. If you eat the skin only of a grape you will find this taste. It generates the dry taste."
Balance,"A wine is balanced if sweet, acidity, tannin, and alcohol are compensating each other"
Length,The way the wine is doing in your palate
Depth,The layers of taste and aromas of the wine
Complexity,A wine is complex if it has a good length and depth
Typicality,If the tastes are similar to the other ones of the same race
What is a bad wine,"If it tastes like a rotten fruit, like vinegar, chemical, oxide, burnt or cork"
Tasting order,"If you taste different wine, here is the recommended order: 1. Sparkling wine; 2. White wine, ros√©s; 3. Young red; 4. Strong white or sweet wine; 5. Strong red wine; 6. Fortified wine"
