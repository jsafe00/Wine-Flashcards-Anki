1. Harvesting,Grapes are harvested
2. Crushing (Red wine),"Grapes are crushed. Juice, seed, and skins are put into a tank."
2. Crushing (White wine),Grapes are pressed. Only the juice is kept. Skins and seeds are removed.
3. Fermentation,The yeast of the juice starts to turn the sugar into alcohol.
4. Ageing,The wine can be put in a barrel to get in contact with the wood.
5. Packaging,The wine is put into bottles.
Red color,The wine goes red through the tannins of the skin (for Red Wine). You can make White wine with red grapes since you remove the skin
Why is sulfite added?,To stop the wine from turning into vinegar
Oak barrel,"Often use for wine ageing, and for white wine, it can also be used during the fermentation"
Rosé wine,Rosé wine is done like the red wine but the juice is taken earlier
Fortified wine,Fortified wine (like Porto wine) are made by adding alcohol at the end to stop the fermentation process
Sparkling wine,"During the fermentation, gas is made, by blocking it into the bottle with the cap, the gas enters into the wine to turn it into sparkle wine"
Table wine alcohol level,"Between 8,5% and 15%"
Fortified wine alcohol level,More than 15%
Vinifera,The type of grapes that can be used to produce wine. There are more than 10 000 varieties.
Characteristics of grapes,"Colors, aromas, acidity, skin thickness. It makes the wine taste different"
Characteristics of vines,"The density of grapes, the number of leafs"
Wood piece,Some cheap wines use wood pieces instead of an oak barrel to simulate the wooden taste
